see https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly for more ideas

maybe this should be two files
one which includes cloning diaspora/diaspora, and one that assumes you already cloned it yourself
maybe one script just calls another?


other ideas what we could do

 1. check that you have ruby installed, if not, point to wiki page and exit
 2. check to see if we need sudo (generally, if it is a system ruby you need sudo, which you can check
    if which ruby is /usr/bin/ruby, or does not have rvm in the path)
 3. check if you have bundle installed and install it, and install with/without sudo if you need it

 check if you have mysql and/or postgres installed, point to wiki page if neither is found.
 (maybe even switch database.yml if this is the case?)

 make it work if you have just cloned diapsora and want a quick setup, or
 support magic install, like this http://docs.meteor.com/#quickstart

It worked! :)

Now, you should have a look at

  - config/database.yml      and
  - config/application.yml

and change them to your liking. Then you should be able to
start Diaspora* in development mode with:

    `rails s`
